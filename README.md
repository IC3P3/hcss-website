```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will start the development server at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Building for Production

```bash
pnpm build
```

Preview the production build:

```bash
pnpm preview
```

### Building an image for Production

```

Run end-to-end tests:

```bash
pnpm test:e2e
```

Run all tests:

```bash
pnpm test
```

## Code Quality
